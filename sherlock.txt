ADVENTURE III CASE IDENTITY

dear fellow said Sherlock Holmes sat either side
fire lodgings Baker Street life infinitely
stranger anything mind man could invent
would dare conceive things really mere
commonplaces existence could fly window
hand hand hover great city gently remove
roofs peep queer things going
strange coincidences plannings crosspurposes
wonderful chains events working generations
leading outré results would make fiction
conventionalities foreseen conclusions stale
unprofitable

yet convinced answered cases
come light papers rule bald enough
vulgar enough police reports realism pushed
extreme limits yet result must confessed
neither fascinating artistic

certain selection discretion must used producing
realistic effect remarked Holmes wanting
police report stress laid perhaps upon
platitudes magistrate upon details
observer contain vital essence whole matter Depend
upon nothing unnatural commonplace

smiled shook head quite understand thinking
said course position unofficial adviser
helper everybody absolutely puzzled throughout
three continents brought contact
strange bizarre hereI picked morning paper
groundlet us put practical test
first heading upon come husbands cruelty
wife half column print know without
reading perfectly familiar
course woman drink push blow
bruise sympathetic sister landlady crudest
writers could invent nothing crude

Indeed example unfortunate one argument
said Holmes taking paper glancing eye
Dundas separation case happens engaged
clearing small points connection
husband teetotaler woman
conduct complained drifted habit
winding every meal taking false teeth hurling
wife allow action likely
occur imagination average storyteller Take
pinch snuff Doctor acknowledge scored
example

papers Holmes brought Among rummaged
read intervals notetaking meditation
past Reading suddenly rolled
gigantic ball tossed onto rack

heard anything case asked

word seen paper days

London press full accounts
looking recent papers order master
particulars seems gather one
simple cases extremely difficult

sounds little paradoxical

profoundly true Singularity almost invariably
clue featureless commonplace crime
difficult bring home case however
established serious case son
murdered man

Well conjectured shall take nothing
granted opportunity looking personally
explain state things far
able understand words

Boscombe Valley country district far Ross
Herefordshire largest landed proprietor part
Mr John Turner made money Australia returned
years ago old country One farms

Turner apparently richer man McCarthy became
tenant still remained seems upon terms perfect

avoided society neighbouring English families
led retired lives though McCarthys fond

June 3rd Monday last McCarthy left house
Hatherley three afternoon walked
Boscombe Pool small lake formed spreading

back alive

Hatherley Farmhouse Boscombe Pool quarter

arrested verdict wilful murder returned
inquest Tuesday Wednesday brought
magistrates Ross referred case next
Assizes main facts case came
coroner policecourt

could hardly imagine damning case remarked
ever circumstantial evidence pointed criminal


Circumstantial evidence tricky thing answered Holmes
thoughtfully may seem point straight one thing
shift point view little may find
pointing equally uncompromising manner something
entirely different must confessed however case
looks exceedingly grave young man
possible indeed culprit several people
neighbourhood however among Miss Turner
daughter neighbouring landowner believe
innocence retained Lestrade may recollect
connection Study Scarlet work case
interest Lestrade rather puzzled referred
case hence two middleaged gentlemen
flying westward fifty miles hour instead quietly
digesting breakfasts home

afraid said facts obvious
find little credit gained case

nothing deceptive obvious fact
answered laughing Besides may chance hit upon
obvious facts may means obvious
Mr Lestrade know well think boasting
say shall either confirm destroy theory
means quite incapable employing even
understanding take first example hand clearly

Sherlock Holmes transformed hot upon scent
Men known quiet thinker logician

darkened brows drawn two hard black lines
eyes shone beneath steely glitter
face bent downward shoulders bowed lips
compressed veins stood like whipcord long
sinewy neck nostrils seemed dilate purely animal

unheeded upon ears provoked quick
impatient snarl reply Swiftly silently made way
along track ran meadows way

path amid short grass bounded either

Hatherley Farm private park wealthy Mr Turner
woods lined upon farther side could see

Pray continue narrative

Mrs St Clair fainted sight blood upon

horrible cry ever listened swelled louder
louder hoarse yell pain fear anger mingled
one dreadful shriek say away
village even distant parsonage cry raised
sleepers beds struck cold hearts

Across lap lay short stock long lash

word soul looked last long
questioning gaze pressing hand cold dank
grasp hurried room

Well came think cool blood
much astonished may think sudden commission
intrusted one hand course
glad fee least tenfold asked
set price upon services possible
order might lead ones hand face
manner patron made unpleasant impression upon
could think explanation
fullersearth sufficient explain necessity
coming midnight extreme anxiety lest tell
anyone errand However threw fears winds ate
hearty supper drove Paddington started
obeyed letter injunction holding tongue

Reading change carriage station
However time last train Eyford
reached little dimlit station eleven oclock
passenger got one upon
platform save single sleepy porter lantern passed
wicket gate however found acquaintance
morning waiting shadow upon side Without

standing open drew windows either
side tapped woodwork away went fast
horse could go

One horse interjected Holmes

Yes saw sidelights stepping
carriage chestnut

Tiredlooking fresh

given facts Since ask however may
say occurred possible excitement
affair consciousness made immense
social stride effect causing little nervous
disturbance wife

short become suddenly deranged

Well really consider turned backI
say upon upon much many aspired
without successI hardly explain fashion

Well certainly also conceivable hypothesis said
Holmes smiling Lord St Simon think
nearly data May ask whether seated

fortunate enough solve problem said
client rising

solved

Eh

say solved

crossquestioning formed conclusions
case client came room

dear Holmes

remarked quite prompt whole examination
served turn conjecture certainty Circumstantial
evidence occasionally convincing find

Holmes rushed round angle house
Toller hurrying behind us huge famished brute
black muzzle buried Rucastles throat writhed
